# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Create an EC2

In this educational example you will create 1 instance and connect to it.

- Navigate to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
- Select your Region
- Click **Launch Instance**

In AWS building an new instance is invoked by "launching" and in the CLI it is invoked by "run-instances"
