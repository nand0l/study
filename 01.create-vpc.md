# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. The first step is to create your VPC. Then you can add resources to it, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. Finally, you can define how your VPCs communicate with each other across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions.

## Create a VPC

In this educational example we are going to create 1 VPC with 2 public subnets.

- Navigate to: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>
- Select your Region
- In the left column select **"Your VPCs"**
- Click **Create VPC**

### VPC Settings

    - Name tag (optional)
        - OSP-VPC-initials
    - IPv4 CIDR block
        10.0.0.0/16
    - Tenancy
        -Default

Please note the Name and the VPC ID.

## Create subnets

A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone.

- In the left column select **"Subnets"**
- Click **Create Subnet**

### Create subnet

    - VPC ID
        - your just created VPC

#### subnet 1 settings

    - Subnet name
        - PubA-OSP-VPC-initials
    - Availability Zone
        - regiona
    - IPv4 CIDR block
        - 10.0.1.0/24

#### subnet 2 settings

    - Subnet name
        - PubB-OSP-VPC-initials
    - Availability Zone
        - regionb
    - IPv4 CIDR block
        - 10.0.2.0/24

Please note the Names and the Subnet IDs.

## Create internet gateway

An internet gateway is a virtual router that connects a VPC to the internet. To create a new internet gateway specify the name for the gateway. After the Internet Gateway is created it needs to be attached to a VPC in order to enable the VPC to communicate with the internet.

- In the left column select **"Internet Gateways"**
- Click **Create Internet gateway**

### Internet gateway settings

    - Name
        - IGW-OSP-VPC-initials

After you created the Internet Gateway it needs to be attached to the VPC.

- In the left column select **"Internet Gateways"**
- Select your just added Internet Gateway
- In the menu **Actions**...

### Attach Internet Gateway to the VPC

    - Available VPCs
        - your just created VPC

Now the VPC is created, 2 subnets are created, an internet gateway is created and it is attached to the VPC.  
In order to use the VPC traffic designated for the internet needs to be routed over the Internet Gateway.

## Create Route tables

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.  
There is already a default routing table but it is best practise to create "your own" routing tables and attach these to the subnets.

- In the left column select **"Route Tables"**
- Click **Create Route table**

### Route table settings

    - Name
        - RTinet-OSP-VPC-initials
    - VPC
        - your just created VPC

## Add a route to the internet

A route for all traffic inside the VPC is already created. A route to the internet will be created by directing all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.

- In the left column select **"Route Tables"**
- select the just created route _"RTinet-OSP-VPC-initials"_
- Click **Edit Routes**

Add the following route:

    - Destination
        - 0.0.0.0/0
    - Target - Internet Gateway
        - your just created IGW-x0x0x0x

Click **Save changes**

After this routing table is created, it needs to be associated with the 2 subnets that were created earlier.

    - In the left column select "Subnets"
    - select PubA-OSP-VPC-initials
        - Edit Route Table Association
        - Select RTinet-OSP-VPC-initials
    - select PubB-OSP-VPC-initials
        - Edit Route Table Association
        - Select RTinet-OSP-VPC-initials
