# Prerequisites and Prework  

In this educational example we are going to create a few ec2 instances and if we want to connect to the terminal of these instancers we need a few items. In production environment you only need 1 of these but we will do the prework for both.  

## Create Key Pair  

A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance.  

- Navigate to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
- Select your Region
- In the left column select **"Key Pairs"**
- Click **Create key pair**

You can choose to download a .pem file or a .pkk file but a .pkk can als be created from the .pem file.  

    - Name
        - OSP-Key-initials
    - Key pair type
        RSA or ED25519
    - Private key file format
        -Depends on your OS (and the tool you use to connect)

Once you click **Create key pair** you file is downloaded to your browser default download location. Save this file in a secure place. We will need it later.  

## Create IAM role  

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provide the ability to grant instances temporary credentials. These temporary credentials can then be used by hosted applications to access permissions configured within the role. IAM roles eliminate the need for managing credentials, help mitigate long-term security risks, and simplify permissions management.  Sometimes roles are reffered to as: IamInstanceProfile  

- Navigate to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
- There is no need to select a region because IAM is a service with a global scope
- In the left column select **"Roles"**
- Click **Create role**

We will create a role and configure it with a policy to use [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) to connect to the terminal of the instance.
